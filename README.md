# Spotify-Programs-using-Python

In this repository, I have created a compilation of concise Python 3 scripts capable of retrieving the top 10 songs by any specified artist or streaming songs from Spotify on your operating system.

# Spotify Song Search & Play Automation

## Overview

This Python script automates the process of searching for a song on Spotify. It uses the `pyautogui` library to simulate keyboard inputs and interacts with the Spotify desktop application to perform a song search.

## How It Works

1. The script prompts the user to enter the name of the song (and optionally, the artist's name).

2. It waits for 2 seconds to give the user time to switch to the Spotify application.

3. The script launches the Spotify application using the `os.system` command.

4. After launching Spotify, it waits for 6 seconds to allow the application to fully load.

5. The script simulates the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + L` to focus on the search bar in Spotify.

6. It types the song name (and artist) into the search bar with a specified typing interval of 0.1 seconds between characters.

7. To execute the search, the script simulates pressing the `Enter` key.

8. Additional key presses (`Page Down`, `Tab`, `Enter`, `Enter`) are used to navigate to and select the desired search result if needed.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Install the `pyautogui` library if you haven't already. You can install it using `pip`:

   ```
   pip install pyautogui
   ```

3. Run the script. It will prompt you to enter the name of the song (and artist, if desired).

4. Switch to the Spotify application within the 2-second timeframe.

5. The script will automate the song search process and select the desired result.

6. Enjoy listening to the song on Spotify!

## Notes

- This script is designed to work with the Spotify desktop application on a Windows system. If you are using a different operating system or Spotify version, you may need to make adjustments to the script.

- Be cautious when automating interactions with applications, and ensure you are complying with Spotify's terms of service and any applicable laws and regulations.

- The script may require adjustments or updates if the Spotify application's user interface changes in the future.
